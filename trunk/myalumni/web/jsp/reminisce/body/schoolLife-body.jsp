                            At school, July 10, 1978 <br>
                            <br>
                            My dearest, sweetest, fondest, fantastic, extra-ordinary,
                            paragon of <br>
                            beauty a.k.a Lizzy. <br>
                            <br>
                            I hope this letter meets you in a fabulous state of metabolism,
                            if so <br>
                            doxology. My principal aim of writing this letter to you
                            is to <br>
                            gravitate your mind towards a matter of global and universal
                            <br>
                            importance, which has been troubling my soul. <br>
                            <br>
                            The matter is so important. Even as I am writing, my adrenalin
                            is 100 <br>
                            per cent on the Richter scale, my temperature is rising,
                            the windvane <br>
                            of my mind is pointing North, South and East at the same
                            time; the <br>
                            mirror in my eyes has only your divine image. Indeed when
                            I sleep, you <br>
                            are the one in my medulla oblongata, and I dream about
                            you. I went out <br>
                            to sea in my dream, and I saw you: surrounded by H20 and
                            you in your <br>
                            majesty rose from the abdomen of the sea like Yemoja,
                            the avatar of <br>
                            beauty. <br>
                            <br>
                            Oh, Lord be with us! We are thy servants!!! <br>
                            <br>
                            As you can see, I am in a serious dilemma. And I want
                            you to take my <br>
                            matter seriously. At this junction, what our Lord said
                            on this matter <br>
                            is germane. He says we should ask, and we shall be given,
                            we should <br>
                            seek and we will find, and that we should knock, and it
                            will be opened <br>
                            unto us. I am this 10th day of the seventh month in the
                            year of our <br>
                            Lord, one thousand, nine hundred and seven eight, asking,
                            seeking and <br>
                            knocking at your door. My prayer is that thou should open
                            so that thy <br>
                            servant can enter. I want to wake up in the morning and
                            see only your <br>
                            face. <br>
                            <br>
                            I want you to be the only sugar in my tea, the only fly
                            in my <br>
                            ointment, the butter on my bread, the grey matter of my
                            system, the <br>
                            oxygen in my head, the planet of my universe, the wall
                            clock of my <br>
                            room. The conveyor belt of my soul. I pray that you realise
                            the <br>
                            gargantuan nature of my predicament. If you refuse, my
                            life will be <br>
                            like tea without sugar, like a snail without shell, a
                            Xmas goat <br>
                            without a horn; in fact I'll become an orphan. What is
                            life if I can't <br>
                            wake up in the morning and behold your face? You model
                            of pulchritude, <br>
                            patiently created by God on a Sunday morning before he
                            went on a <br>
                            deserved holiday. <br>
                            <br>
                            Please Lizzy, let me be your Romeo. Make me the Adam to
                            your Eve. <br>
                            Shakespeare said it all: if music be the food of love,
                            play on. I want <br>
                            to emphasise, universally and responsibly, that you are
                            love itself. <br>
                            You are the metaphor, oxymoron, thesis, antithesis, irony,
                            gerund, <br>
                            conjunction and the adverb of love. <br>
                            <br>
                            At this juncture, let me also say that geography of your
                            body is a <br>
                            permanent allelluia. Not from your body, ammonia, urea
                            and iodine- you <br>
                            are too beautiful for that, what I see in your body is
                            milk and honey. <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At this juncture, brevity is the soul of wit. A stitch
                            in time saves <br>
                            nine. Procrastination is the thief of time. An opportunity
                            once lost <br>
                            can never be regained. Make hay while the sun shines.
                            All that <br>
                            glitters is not gold. The journey of a thousand years
                            begins with a <br>
                            step. What God has put together let no man put asunder.
                            To be a man is <br>
                            not an easy task even if God's time is the best. But time
                            waits for no <br>
                            one. A man without love is like a fish out of water. <br>
                            <br>
                            I know you are a sagacious girl. If you like the veracity
                            of what I <br>
                            am saying, please fill the attached form and let me have
                            it pronto. <br>
                            The mark at the bottom of this page is a kiss from me
                            to you. <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>I remain, Your beloved, faithful, loyal, One and only
                            admirer. </p>

                          <p>Comment on Mr Fashugba and Uncle Ben:&nbsp; (12-1-1999)</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;They were neighbors, one was&nbsp; short and rotund,
                            the other tall and lean, one has a bushy physiognomy,
                            the other a very mean countenance. They have a lot in
                            common, they are fearful, have deep voices , live close
                            to each other and as a way of life&nbsp; dislike wicked
                            senior students.</p>
                          <p>Near the former Red house (what do they call it now?
                            Owena or Hedejeira?), not so far from the make shift Moslem
                            praying ground, is Bros. Ben's house. A little humble
                            bungalow surrounded with poor flowers of faded leaves,
                            he has a rabbitry and I think poultry. I used to wonder
                            if that was his ancestor's shrine for his countenance
                            changes whenever he carries the bush of tallinium triangular
                            to feed his rabbits, probably his happiest moment of the
                            day. Mey Lord's house though of the same type, looks bigger
                            and more domestic probably because of the sugar cane groove,
                            the&nbsp; traditional tripod kitchen, more cleared area
                            as backyard and of course his medium sized family.</p>
                          <p>Bros. Ben is a tall fellow with a rugged face, he teaches
                            Agricultural Science and he was the seniors' darling,
                            as a junior student, all you need to do to make a senior
                            crumbles is to call Bros. Ben's name. . He handles the
                            cane very well and sometimes, Omotade's choice when it
                            comes to whipping machines (<i>for the generation X, Omotade
                            was the Principal then</i>). He is best known among the
                            seniors, though he never taught me I was so sure then,
                            that the Adam's apple that sits conspicuously on his thin
                            throat will make his deep voice a bit scary. Never the
                            less he loves students, he plays with and even gist us
                            old stories especially of Biafra.</p>
                          <p>His Volkswagen! That lonely landlord of the Technology
                            block. The best he did with the car was occasional strolling
                            in it; he will always take his time to warm it. But most
                            time, the car always sits there, grinning from grateful
                            patting though unconsciously incessant, of oily fingers
                            of Ogbonno soup by students returning from the dinning
                            hall.</p>
                          <p>Is there any one out there without his idiosyncrasy,
                            (I 'd rather called it madness), anyway, his was that
                            he drinks, you appreciate his other side better after
                            a drinking bout, then you see the African story teller
                            in him. He will not only talk but with a lot of genuflection
                            and gyrations.</p>
                          <p>Mey Lord was a family man short with a bushy face, his
                            voice makes differentiation between a Barry White's and
                            an Igbo masquerade's voice a frustrating effort. He is
                            humble and his frequent responses of &quot;<b><i><font color="#FF0000">Mey
                            Lord Sir, Your Obedient Servant </font>&quot;</i></b>
                            might have well attested to this. His poultry were pastime
                            to adventurous, senior students, he teaches religious
                            knowledge and you can't miss the catechism and relish
                            with which he relates those bible stories, as his voice
                            vibrates between a crescendo of confidence and a didactic
                            descend. He teaches Literature in English too and was
                            the main person overseeing the Press Club's affairs for
                            a very long time.</p>
                          <p>He seems to want everything to be modest. I&nbsp; once
                            told a friend mischievously ,that it is probably because
                            of his short stature that&nbsp; he hates anything too
                            short. He once tore my very tight and thigh revealing
                            green knickers, celebrating it with six&nbsp; &quot;pepperish
                            kpankere&quot; (that Siam flexible cane). He almost knew
                            everyone by name and of course he has his own folks. He
                            was a good teacher though and a resolute man. He once
                            had a face off with Mr. Akanbi the VP. It was on a hot
                            Tuesday afternoon, after a lunch of Eba and burnt Egusi
                            soup. We were resuming for the afternoon prep while his
                            guttural protest dominated the whole school compound.
                            &quot; With all respect, Mey Lord, you have no right to
                            tell me that&quot;, matching determinedly towards Akanbi,
                            &quot;I have logged more years in the civil services than
                            you&quot; you can not intimidate me with such spurious&#133;&quot;he
                            continued. I couldn't wait to to hear the rest , that
                            single word , spurious, sent me scampering for my Michael
                            West dictionary&#133;. I was disappointed not finding
                            it there, being a library mole; I made the word during
                            the night prep in the library.</p>
                          <p>There were always stories about them, there was one on
                            MEY LORD; one day while making a nightly round, trying
                            to roost the good boys to sleep, some notorious boys in
                            Red House room 5, prepared a welcome show for him. The
                            door was left ajar, with a bucketful of soapy mixture
                            of all known putriences, expertly seated onthe door's
                            top, such that if anyone tries to open the door, the bucket
                            will shift and bathe the intruder with its content. It
                            was told that he did came and was bathed, while the room
                            occupants with stifled giggles feigned ignorance! This
                            incidence actually ended his nocturnal excursions. </p>
                          <p>None the less, most of us of that generation will never
                            forget the duo. Somehow they would have impacted some
                            thing into our lives. I consider them not only as some
                            of the greatest teachers that ever passed through idoani,but
                            as men of values, who stood by what they believe with
                            all they have while making tremendous contributions in
                            producing the giants out of FGC idoani.</p>
                          <p>There were other great teachers, The likes of Mr Olabode,
                            Adejayan,Okezie I think ?,Mr Adeshina&nbsp; the school
                            coach, Mrs Adebua</p>
                          <p>Mr Popoola, (Achampong), Mr Okon,Mr Achamua ,the Ghanian
                            English tutor, in fact almost all of them are great teachers.
                            I hope we still have&nbsp; the like of them there now.i
                            will encourage you to try and comment on these people
                            aforementioned. I am so sure a lot of us we love to have
                            information on their present situations.</p>
