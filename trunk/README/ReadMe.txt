* LOOKING FOR DEVELOPERS
  Send me an email that you would like to contribute to the "myAlumni" project, 
  and also get yourself a gmail account if you dont have one. Looking for the following
  skill {java, jsp, hibernate, spring, RDMS, JSTL, documentations, web designers, graphic designers}

* The first cut of the code would be checked in very soon (Cleaning up), I would 
  consider it to be in a beta version, but with still some generic customization to be done.

* Looking for whom might take care of the look and feel to bring it up to date with what might 
  look like a web 2.0 application (current look and feel can be found at http://www.fgcidoani.org, 
  mind you that version is about 2 years old and have be revamped since then)

* Application currently supports Mysql and looking to port it to other databases

* Go to http://code.google.com/p/myalumni/ for the lastest status of the project.
