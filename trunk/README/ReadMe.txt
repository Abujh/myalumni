* Looking for developers, send me an email that you would like to contribute to the myAlumni Project, and also prepare
  your with a gmail account handy. Looking for skill as follows {java, jsp, hibernate, spring, rdms, jstl, documentations, web designers, graphic designers}

* The first cut of the code would be checked in very soon, I would consider it to be in a 
beta version, but with still some generic customization to be done.

* Looking for whom might take care of the look and feel to bring it up to date with what might look like a web 2.0 application (current look and feel can be found at http://www.fgcidoani.org, mind you that version is about 2 years old and have be revamped since then)

* Application currently supports Mysql and looking to port it to other databases
