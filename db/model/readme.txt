The datbase mode was created using DBDesigner Fork r1.4.

DB Designer Fork is a fork of the fabulous fabForce DB Designer 4. While DB Designer 4 was a system optimized for MySQL, DB Designer Fork generates scripts for Firebird/InterBase, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL. DBD Fork makes modeling, querying and SQL scripting easy tasks.
