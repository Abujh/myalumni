*
*  4. Backup your users' avatars in your App Server in this

*     (The above folder is relative to the webapp dir of your App Server)
*
*  5. Back up all your config (.properties and/or .xml files) in your App Server in this
*     folder: WEB-INF\classes (Backup this for reference only)

2. System requirements
---------------------------------------------------
- Any App Server SUPPORTS Jsp 1.2 and Servlet 2.3 (myAlumni WILL NOT
    run on Jsp 1.1/Servlet 2.2 Container such as Tomcat 3/ JRun 3)
  NOTE: myAlumni CANNOT run on Orion App Server because Orion does not
        fully support Jsp 1.2 and Servlet 2.3

- JDK 1.4 or later 

- One of supported databases with a JDBC 2.0 compliant driver
  (this release includes 2 drivers: postgreSQL and hsqldb)


3. Application Server Setup
---------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you use JRun 4, JBoss and have problem with log4j, please remove log4j.jar from WEB-INF/lib

NOTE: If you use JRun 4 or Tomcat 5.x and have problem with log4j,
      please read logging configuration guide in the file WEB-INF/classes/commons-logging.properties

NOTE: If you use old version of Resin and you have error with the xml parser,
      you should delete file web.xml, and rename web.xml.resin to web.xml
      (Only need if you have problem with XML parser)

NOTE: Your App Server SHOULD NOT be installed in a folder whose path name contains
      the space character. For example, "C:\Program Files" contains a space character
      and that can pose problems.

- Unzip the distribution zip file into a folder

- Create a context in your app server. In Tomcat, just create a dir
  (for example : myAlumni) in the tomcat/webapps. This dir (context)
  MUST be in lower case (such as myalumni). Note that in some
  app server such as Web Logic, you MUST deploy the context, just create
  a context dir will not work.

- Create a home folder for myAlumni, which MUST NOT be accessible from
  the web (This folder could be in your WEB-INF folder, such as WEB-INF/myAlumniHome)
  This myAlumniHome folder IS VERY IMPORTANT, it is used to store the log files, 
  uploaded avatar.
  myAlumni WILL NOT run if you did not configure it properly
  NOTE: if you do not use the default WEB-INF/myAlumniHome, then copy the content
        of folder WEB-INF/myAlumniHome to your new folder myAlumniHome. 


4. Database Setup
---------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Before running the script, we highly recommend that you back up all your data.

NOTE: If you use MySql 4.1.x or 5.0.x, please see help at
      http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/connector-j-installing-upgrading.html

The below database setup is for NEW INSTALLATION ONLY:

- In the extracted folder, find the file sql/<database>/*.sql
  (<database> is the database you would like to setup)

- Create a database 

- Run the create sql script and then the load.sql. Please see your database document for detail on how to run a sql script

- Copy the JDBC driver for your database to the WEB-INF/lib folder of your context

     

5. Admin Login
---------------------------------------------------
There are 2 links by default:
If you install in a context other than ROOT context, the url looks like this:
http://www.[yourserver].com/[yourcontext]/myalumni : home for myAlumni

- The first time the application run, you would be directored to a Setup page. fill
 this out and submit.

- Login using = sysadmin  and password = password

- If Login successfully, click on Administer system and then the admin tab. click a validate System Configuration to check the config


Congratulation, you have installed myAlumni successfully.
