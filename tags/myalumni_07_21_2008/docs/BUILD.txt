BUILD INSTRUCTION
---------------------------------------------


To build myAlumni, either from the source package or from SVN, follow
the following steps:
Note: after building myAlumni, see the INSTALL.txt for the instruction
      to setup myAlumni on your Servlet Container.

1. Get the source code, if you have the source package, just extract
   it to a folder. If you don't have the source package or you would
   like to build the latest development source code, check out from
   SVN. See the Subversion.txt for detailed information.

2. Download ant build tool from http://jakarta.apache.org, then config it
   (please see the document from the ant package)

3. Edit file ant\task\build.properties to suit your need and/or environment

4. cd to folder ant\task, then type ant:
   cd ant
   cd task
   ant

5. the myAlumni webapp is created in folder myAlumni/build/webapp


NOTE: If you are a developer, then config the build.properties
      and set the proper value for tomcat-deploy. Then you could
      deploy to your servlet container with this command:

      ant tomcat-deploy


The build process should be easy and without any error. If there is
not any error, Ant should print out BUILD SUCCESSFUL message.

We hope you will enjoy myAlumni :)
