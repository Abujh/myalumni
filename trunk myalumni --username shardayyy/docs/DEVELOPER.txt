This document is for developers intend to customize and/or extend myAlumni


Q. How to receive SVN commit update mail?

A. Please subscribe to <TODO email>



Q. How to customize the style of myAlumni?

A. myAlumni support customize the style by changing the myalumni.css. You could change
   a lot of style with this, but there are some changes which you have to make
   directly to the *.jsp files. This will be addressed in later releases.
  

Q. How can I join the myAlumni development team?

A. Like many current members of the myAlumni team, joining the development team
should be naturally:

- Participate on the online naijatek.com, help others to solve their problem and discuss
  how to improve myAlumni

- Get familiar with the current mvnForum source code and begin writing some patch.

- Prepare a plan on what part of myAlumni that you would like to contribute your effort.
  You could publicly discuss it on the myAlumni or send me an email. This will help
  to avoid wasted time if two or more people trying to do the same tasks.

- Send me an email that you would like to contribute to the myAlumni, and also prepare
  your sourceforge.net ID or gmail ID

- Stick to the existing indentation style even if you hate it. Alternating between
  indentation styles makes it hard to understand the source code. Make it hard on
  yourself but easier on others. myAlumni follows the Code Conventions for the
  Java Programming Language (http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/).

- If you contribute to the current source code, put your name and email in the header
  of current files

- If you write new files, use the copyright notice in the docs/CopyrightTemplate.txt
  (It has template for .java files and .Jsp files). You also agree to grant copyright
  of the source code to Naijatek.com, and don't forget to put your name and email
  to the header of the files.

- Please test your code carefully before commit to the SVN, if you are going to make
  quite a lot of changes, please discuss it in the online Naijatek.com so that others
  could have a chance to review and give you suggestions.



Cheers!
