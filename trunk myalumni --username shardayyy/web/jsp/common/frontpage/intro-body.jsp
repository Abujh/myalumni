	    <td><p>Hello and welcome to Federal Government College Ido-ani's unofficial BUT becoming the hangout spot in Cyberspace. This web page was designed to help keep alive the line of communications between friends, and us alumni&#146;s since we are geographically located all over the globe.<br>
                              <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also our hope that this page would act as a meeting point, for past alumnus as well as friends of our school making it easier to re-establish friendships and work towards a meaningful contribution to our school and our country as a whole.</p>
      <p>So I would say lets make the best of it, and feel proud that <i>you once experienced what made you what you are today</i>. Take care and God bless.</td>
