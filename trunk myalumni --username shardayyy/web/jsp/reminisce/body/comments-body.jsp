              Hey you why <br>
              are you not in your class for night prep...now go to the borehole and
              <br>
              fetch me a bucket of water for me (senior please now I have appendix,
              <br>
              I cannot carry bucket on my head,ok go and lie down there on the <br>
              floor). Ha!Ha!Ha!...Please pardon me I was just browsing through FGC
              <br>
              Idoani site and I was reminiscing on the past and I thought I should
              <br>
              share it with everyone.</p>
            <p align="center">You know it is so relieving to know that we are no longer
              lost in <br>
              this big world after school, many thanks to the webmaster of this <br>
              school site God bless you.</p>
            <p align="center">When I look back at Idoani, flashes of the past keep
              rushing to my <br>
              mind. How we were made to construct angle 90,....hmmm...mount the <br>
              bunk because you don't have milk or sugar to give to a senior. Think
              <br>
              of the dining hall, someone climbs the stage and says; after the <br>
              prayers I want you to consume everything on your table &quot;bow your
              head <br>
              for prayers&quot;, before he finishes saying, bless this food oh!...phew!
              <br>
              the pots are empty (Everybody in Idoani had the rushing instints, <br>
              both boys and girls). Now to set everybody up they say nobody should
              <br>
              carry food out of the dining hall, while you're trying to rush your
              <br>
              food the 'gong' goes for Siesta and the house captain will definitely
              <br>
              punish you for either not being around or coming late for siesta. And
              <br>
              God help you if the labour prefect catches you outside.</p>
            <p align="center">How many of you went to 'zombie lake' or 'dam' to fetch
              water? The <br>
              sweetest moments for a junior student is visiting day and when it is
              <br>
              a day to vacation and we are in the assembly hall after all the <br>
              principal's bla bla bla, we sing the school anthem, &quot;FGC Idoani
              we <br>
              greet thee.....we greet thee dear principal we hail thee all our <br>
              staff...&quot; and everyone goes back to pack up.</p>
            <p align="center">School was fun come to think of it with all those crazy
              things that <br>
              were done in the past. I will never forget some people in my life, <br>
              first there is this guy 'Egbon Seyi' who asked me to carry his box <br>
              from main gate to yellow house. The painful thing about that incident
              <br>
              was that, it was my first day in boarding school(April 88) and my <br>
              father had just left five minutes before then. That was where I met
              <br>
              Dapo Adewole 'Holy man'(where is he?), I carried his box for a while
              <br>
              and then I ran away. The guy caught me later and flogged hell out of
              <br>
              me. Seyi became my friend later because he started house fellowship
              <br>
              which I attended. There was this guy I feared and hated to see, <br>
              Nataniel Ehijator 'Don' I tried to avoid him like a plague because <br>
              &quot;the guy beat yeye commot for my body&quot;, and we were both in
              red <br>
              house. There are some other guys that were really mean to me I guess
              <br>
              because I was stubborn and I hated manual labour. People like Godwin
              <br>
              (Red House captain), Ebong Udom, Hey I will never forget this guy <br>
              'Lesoto'(Yellow House). That guy asked me to mount the bunk for about
              <br>
              4 hours and he flogged me. I cannot remember what led to that.</p>
            <p align="center">All the same those experiences made me strong and bold,
              and wow I <br>
              really miss everyone I hope everyone is ok. Everyone has their own <br>
              story to tell about Idoani, share yours when you can.</p>
            <p align="center">Take care everyone and God bless. Remember God first
              in anything you <br>
              do. Prayerful preparation will always prevent poor performance.</p>

            <p>I'm particularly thrilled by this opportunity to get in contact with
              all u guys out there. I just read an old guy's comment about school
              being a training ground. With all respect, i sincerely feel that's an
              understatement. That place was more than that, it was and i hope it
              still is a ranch, a labour room, u don't go in there and not bring something
              outta it, u come out different from u were before u went in.<br>
              Even if u failed your finals, u are already prepared to face it, even
              when Ojonuba harasses you and treats you like you were dog mistakenly
              born human, u are already trained to laugh at it.<br>
              People! I loooooooove that school, and this is still understating it,
              it's made a part of me that has successfully confronted certain odds
              of life. And coming to think of it, u guys were part of my training
              and i deeply appreciate y'all.<br>
              Those that beat me made me strong, those that pet me made me know how
              to love and those i beat helped me realise the alternative to beating.
              If u sent me on an errand, u sure made me know how to do certain things
              much better and if I sent you too, and you delivered, u helped me reduce
              my stress at that time, and if u absconded, you only taught me to learn
              to help myself and not depend.<br>
              'Twas all fun, all the last night's solution, all the carrying of bases
              of garri, all the adventures over the fence to look for mango and the
              sorts, all the duel between the Ninja turtles and the 'A' Team of Moody
              and Co., all the jeerings at fegicola girls and the chance-of-a-whole-year
              entering into the girls' hostel by the boys immediately after inter-house
              sport and all those things we did together that seemed crazy but are
              actually what made that place the paradise we all now wish should not
              have come to an end. I mean the good, the bad and the ugly all appear
              good to me now.<br>
              It was 'fun' while it lasted and FUN while I remember it now.<br>
              One more thing makes me glad 'bout that place, 99% of us are so strong
              and doing well in life now that a number of people want to go to that
              school and that's why I said I hope it still is that 2nd heaven that
              I look back and see that it really was. UP SCHOOL!<br>
              Let's continue to hold ourselves together. I say &quot;Together Forever&quot;.<br>
              And to you folks that put this site up, you have my my thumbs and toes
              up, I appreciate you.<br>
              If you get to read this, then get back to me. I came a rookie in '87
              and left a conqueror in '92. Ropo Akindumila was the tag, Alex Akindumila
              now is the name. Peace folks.</p>

            <p>Infact, i'm really short of words but FGC Idoani really made me who
              I am today. Talk of the experience(s), and all sorts. Infact I would
              want the authorities to just organize say a week or two with to from
              my set so that we stay together on the same soil. Though this won't
              be possible but this is to tell U I'd always like to go to FGC Idoani.
              The stress from the seniors is what is keeping me on in life now, 'cos
              am studying a course(MED. &amp; SURG.) with a lot of stress coupled
              with Unilorin stress. I would have blamed myself if I hadn't come to
              FGC Idoani not talk of someone gisting me.<br>
