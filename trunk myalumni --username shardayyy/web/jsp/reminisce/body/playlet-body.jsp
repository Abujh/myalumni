   <P align=center><EM><FONT color=#003300>On a hot afternoon, students were
   streaming in after lunch preparing to start their siesta. the time is around
   3:15pm.The room looks dirty and stuffy , most of the louvres blades have been
   broken , the few ones left hung dangerously at the upper part of the window
   making them to like like an ababdon motherless home. Grafitti adorned the walls
   of the room, some read "<SPAN class=main>Kaspepe here today , gone tomorrow",
   "Alabe was here""Say me well Alhaji Bello", "The downfall of a man is not the
   end of his life", Apartheid is a crime against humanity" etc </SPAN>. There are
   about twenty bunks in the room , neatly laid in a row of ten with not well laid
   beds of white turned brown bedsheets , clothes littered the floor, at each
   corner of the room , the bunks took another pattern, quite unlike others, white
   clothes were wound around them , looking more like the a <SPAN
   class=actor>Sango</SPAN> shrine, about two cupboards in each corners, the locks
   on the cupboard looks scrappy, partially destroyed by incessant break ins. On
   top of this particular corner is the popular tin box of the "Eze goes to school
   fame". The name on the box has been tainted by a patina caused by dried garri
   and other fluidy food substances., by the side of the cupboard is a red desk
   clearly marked FGC-IDOANI, JSS 2B. , a white school uniform rests on a chair
   married to the desk, reclining on a neatly laid white bed sheet is <SPAN
   class=actor><STRONG>Leggii</STRONG></SPAN> a final year student reading a a
   novel " trouble in form six". </FONT></EM></P>
   <P><SPAN class=actor>Sugbeya</SPAN><SPAN class=narations> a classmate strolled

   spreading over his face , he looks serious suddenly</SPAN>: </P>
   <P><SPAN class=actor>Legii</SPAN>:<SPAN class=main>Oh good news, i used to tell

   <P><SPAN class=actor>Leggii</SPAN>: <SPAN class=main>tell me Friend Sugbeya ,

   infinity, equilibrium is no where to be found, ...</SPAN><SPAN

   <P class=narations>A junior student strolled in , he has two empty plates
   smeared with a fluidly red soup . he looks terrified , summoning enough courage
   , he barged into their conversation:</P>

   your food away ! May they see their nose without a mirror, may their father
   sleeps on empty stomach </SPAN>....<SPAN class=actor>Leggii</SPAN> <SPAN

   students in the dinning hall, the easier his job",he will say, even if i carried

   class=actor>Sugbeya's</SPAN><SPAN class=narations> cup into a sack of garri,
   </SPAN><SPAN class=actor>Sugbeya</SPAN><SPAN class=narations> faced lit up at
