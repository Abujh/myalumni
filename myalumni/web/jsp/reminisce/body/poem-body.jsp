                              <p> <strong>Aboki,ba ni tom-tom neera gomma </strong>,
                                I pointed a 10 naira note to the Hausa man. I always
                                use languages like these to identify with my fellow
                                Nigerians, based on perceived ethnicity; I will mischievously
                                address an ibo man , Nna ..or slot a indigenous greetings
                                like, <strong>mpak abodie</strong> for an ibibio (
                                south-south Nigeria) , then I will laced my request
                                with a mellifluous pidgin English to win him/her over
                                . I tell you , I always win , no matter how unfriendly
                                such person is. Nigeria is a country where one must
                                learn the intricacies of survival, no matter how minute
                                or trivial.</p>
                              <p>It has been drizzling all day, making the weather
                                to look very dull and wear a crepuscular gloom. June
                                and July are notorious for somewhat heavy and lazy
                                rainfall in south-west Nigeria. On a day like this,
                                you are seldom hungry, but I was ! I had just gulp
                                a plate of amala (cassava flour paste) and fresh fish.
                                I needed a mouth freshener and the closest and most
                                popular is the mint tom-tom sweet . I have picked
                                my sweets and was about turning back when I was held
                                to the spot. I caught a word out of the Hausa conversation
                                going on between aboki's friends; <strong>Nageji</strong>
                                ! that was the word. Can I ever forget that word -
                                spoken in a fervor of agitation , it connotes the
                                dawn of trouble.</p>
                              <p>I momentarily checked myself and I smiled as I walked
                                away. <strong>Nageji</strong>, in Hausa language,
                                I learnt out of curiosity to mean literally I am tired,
                                it may also connotes , ignore or make less significant
                                depending on contextual usage . Some times it is used
                                to signify absolute exasperation during an augment..
                                <strong>Nageji</strong> meant a lot to me, it always
                                sends me back to my school days. It is a story that
                                keeps me chuckling all day. Let's go back to 1988,
                                Red house federal Government college , ido-ani, </p>
                              <p> It was at that period when students lockers are
                                decorated with empty tins of powdered milk and lifeless
                                sack of garrii. Haven missed my lunch, I was prowling
                                the locker room during the prep hour, looking for
                                a Good Samaritan that will help me with some thing
                                anything ! to eat.. I wondered these days why I dont
                                eat much, I used to think then- what is knowledge
                                when the brain is famished, nonsense, Id rather seek
                                food, then book, I always concluded self righteously.</p>
                              <p>A piteous look and a gaping empty plastic plate,
                                I rested on a locker, defiantly ignoring senior students
                                that pass by. From no where, there appears some Hausa
                                boys, I could easily recognize Yaro, an ss II student,
                                noted for his cantankerous attitude and famed sing-song
                                of all known political vocabularies. He will seamlessly
                                turn the definitions of terms such as oligarchy, gerontocracy,
                                democracy, anarchy etc into a melodious sing song
                                to the admiration of his friends and onlookers. He
                                held firmly a metal bucket filled with whitish yam-like
                                stems steaming hot, I gaped in wonderment , in disbelief
                                , I rubbed my eyes to check if I am seeing right and
                                that was when I realized it was CASSAVA ! , Cassava
                                ? the word dropped out of my mouth and my stomach
                                churned in utter revolt, I thought , these fellow
                                are crazy , why eating poisonous cassava in the name
                                of hunger, No ! this is greed ,and utter gluttony,
                                I reasoned silently. I dare not attempt that, even
                                if I miss 2 days worth of meals . Following closely
                                is another student with a half gallon of palm oil
                                , apparently stolen from the school kitchen. The Cassava
                                must have been stolen from the near by igbirra farm
                                or some poor teachers cassava plots.</p>
                              <p> In amazement mixed with curiosity I tip toed after
                                them until they disappeared into one of the inner
                                rooms opposite the locker room. In a flurry of activities
                                and cacophony of Hausa and English , these strange
                                boys seem to be enjoying a sumptuous meal, I kept
                                peering through the key hole. Hey , <strong>what are
                                looking por here</strong> I was startled by the commanding
                                tone of short-stature Senior <strong>Salisu</strong>.
                                . Senior Salisu is an arrogant and choleric natured
                                person. I once had one or two unpleasant encounter
                                with him and I never wished him any good .He made
                                up for his short height with a tall heart of wickedness.
                                He is feared among the juniors and it is every juniors
                                secret wish to get him cornered on a neutral ground
                                and beat the hell out of him. </p>
                              <p>Senior Salisu barged into the room and what happen
                                next made me ran as far as my tired legs could take
                                me. Babu must have been the ring leader of the cassava
                                escapade and Salisu wanted to partake or take control,
                                being a senior student. I saw Senior Salisu reversing
                                towards the door from which I was peering and another
                                student advancing towards him both were struggling
                                with the hot bucket of steaming cassava, I dodged
                                behind a locker and I gleefully watched the whole
                                movie.</p>
                              <p>Now Salisu kept backing off as Babu advanced towards,
                                in a torrent of unbridled Hausa ,most of which I cant
                                understand except that it was spoken in furry and
                                really meant trouble. They seemed to boast at each
                                other. All of a dive , Babu lurched at Salisu and
                                held his collar with one hand and the other hand tenaciously
                                on the bucket of cassava as Salisu continues to wrestle
                                the bucket. , the hot exchange continues and onlookers
                                were watching fearfully. Babu is noted for his no
                                nonsense stance and I could read that they anticipated
                                he would get their meal off the wicked senior , but
                                the result of such audacity may land them all in serious
                                trouble , not only with Salisus colleagues , but may
                                get noticed by the school authority. To act as if
                                not partial, the other boys begged them to stop. Salisu
                                , apparently disturbed by Babu gaining an upper hand
                                , stopped his Hausas ranting and commanded in English
                                ; Babu, Babu kneel down I said, kneel down, he kept
                                shouting , ignoring Babus hausa boasting. Now the
                                situation has become riotous and more people were
                                trying to get Babu to obey. After a while, he succumbed
                                and interestingly knelt down. Haven gained enough
                                ground , Salisu adjusted his uniform , sat on a locker
                                and commanded the other students to bring the bucket
                                of cassava , methodically and with a collected mien
                                , he poured the palm oil into a bowl ,dipped a stem
                                of cassava and graciously put it in his mouth, his
                                cheek expanding and he rolled his eyes to savor the
                                prized delicacy. He burst into a choke of laughter
                                at Babus murderous glaring and taunted him. Calling
                                him <strong>Barawo bansa</strong>! among other obscenities
                                in Hausa , judging by the murderous look displayed
                                by Babu. Salisu seems to enjoy his sweet revenge ,
                                he had quickly forgotten about Babus recent manhandle.
                              </p>
                              <p> After a while , Babu couldnt take it any longer
                                , he lurched forward , snapped the bowl of palm oil
                                and poured it on Salisu, spoiling for war , he thundered
                                <strong>Kai, mu manta da seniority , muchi buron ubaka</strong>.
                                Then he dropped the bombshell, <strong>NAGEJI SENIORITY,
                                NAGEJI TURENCHI</strong> , he emphasized with a clenched
                                fist hitting the locker on which Salisu was sitting
                                , He continued forcefully ,<strong>YAA YAA KII GENERAL
                                BEATING , YAA YAA KII PHYSICAL COMBAT, MERCILESS FIGHTING
                                ,..AH AH AH AH !</strong>, , he roared. Mad, like
                                someone possessed , he grabbed Salisu by the neck
                                and dragged him through the length of the locker room,
                                He looked murderous and lost to this part of the world
                                while salisu hanged lifelessly on his grip - a sorry
                                sight with marshy yellow cassava paste mixed with
                                saliva dropping from the corner of his once prideful
                                mouth, he looked more like an abstract-art piece with
                                the red color of the palm oil expertly gracing the
                                yellowish cassava paste extruding from his battered
                                lips in a wavy form like the tail of letter Q. Babu
                                kept dragging him , hitting his head on lockers and
                                taunting him to fight back., Some senior students
                                later came to Salisus rescue and Babu ran away from
                                the messy cassava littered locker room before the
                                senior students could decide on what to do with him.
                                Apparently at a loss on how to revive the almost dying
                                salisu, keep the humiliation secret and clean the
                                messy locker room, they looked confused and never
                                bothered at finding the culprits, all who have disappeared
                                into thin air.</p>
                              <p> Nagejii, uhhmmm I soliloquy , in my hideout as I
                                laughed silently , the short devil has been humiliated
                                by his brother , I chuckled . Unobtrusively and obviously
                                filled, forgetting my hunger, I made my way to the
                                back of the house, bursting into an uncontrollable
                                fit of laughter. </p>
                              <p>So whenever you hear nageji from an hausa man , you
                                had better be careful, his patience might be fast
                                eroding and the result, need I tell you. fatal !!!</p>

                          <p>Walking down the Marina this morning to my office, i
                            was accosted by a wiff of harmattan haze that got me startled
                            . I stopped and looked around,' harmattan?', I asked myself
                            . As if to confirm it, the green and red Christmas' banner
                            displayed at the entrance of First Bank , Marina, blinked
                            the Christmas' light at me and i winked spontaneously......So
                            Christmas is here ....uhm christmas ! That season of dryness
                            and cracked lips. Then the usual fear came upon me .......the
                            year is caving in .........soon we shall greet each other
                            happy new year! . Slowly, thought of years back started
                            filtering in..... those days at the ido ani.....those
                            Christmas carols ...the crocked jollof rice......last
                            night frolics of 1st term.............folks, those were
                            yuletide! Then I always look forward to raking Christmas
                            bounties from uncles...now my junior folks will ask ,
                            <i>&quot;uncle bunmi ,wetin dey for chrismas now&quot;</i>
                            <br>
                            Those days at ido ani ... I mused, shaking my head, as
                            a mischievous smile merrily warms its way up my contused
                            face. All at once I was flooded with images of those years
                            &#133;..Brisk greetings and flashy acknowledgments, I
                            settled down quickly at my desk and began to knead my
                            laptop's keyboard. Folks let me sing to you the ido-ani
                            old carols!</p>
                          <p>By now , we would have rounded up with the tests and
                            mini exams and it'll be less than three days to get home.
                            Christmas carol will be on Thursday and by Friday it will
                            be over till the following year. Now the atmosphere will
                            be very dry you see students moving in dusty sandals,
                            cracked lips and white faces. Clothes will be spread on
                            that green-turned brown expanse between dining hall and
                            green house. The classroom area suddenly turned desolated
                            - except for few secretive lovers - as students mill around
                            the staff room, dinning hall and the main football field.
                          </p>
                          <p>A walk through the dining hall will see you meeting people
                            like Adelaja, my good friend, Jide Adeladan , Dapo Adegoke,
                            Jasper (my hero from nearby Idogun village) and a school
                            of great Fine-artists (we've got a bunch then, remember
                            ) all under the supervision of the school Fine - Art teachers
                            ; Mr Popoola (archampong.) and Mr Etuk - decorating the
                            dining hall with posters and great nativity picture. </p>
                          <p>The choirs should be some where in the Technology Block
                            putting finishing touches to their voices and acts. The
                            cooks will be busy stirring 'the -much-look forward-to
                            Jolli' (jollof rice). You can't afford not to partake
                            in the festive activities ...for people like me then ..i
                            would have washed my plates ...and made ready to collect
                            plates of rice and fried meats from already made food
                            deals!.(the language then was 'bargain')</p>
                          <p>You wouldn't miss our indefatigable chaplain , Mr OLABODE
                            , at his best, negotiating with all concerned parties
                            to make the event a success. His ubiquitous white Peugeot
                            504; OD something E will be seen running through the school
                            only rivaled by the school bus that shuttles between the
                            school and ido-ani town .</p>
                          <p>Remember the senior all juniors then love...Pateh! Biodun
                            Akinrowo..the incumbent father Christmas ...with his dandy
                            and swaggering gait you would not know his name wasn't
                            <b>santabiodun Akinclaus!</b> Any way he is such a father
                            Christmas in real life for he gives freely and of course
                            takes freely!!!!. I don't know how he gets his paraphernalia.....
                            I used to ask my friend does he bring it to school.</p>
                          <p>7.00pm the bell will ring ...that old rugged behind Red
                            house! and you'll see students in white and purple check
                            trooping out for dinner and the carol. Then, we would
                            have been spent arranging the dinning hall to suit the
                            chapel prefect/social prefect's taste . &quot;whoever
                            designed this U shaped hall did a bad job , does he think
                            of only food!&quot; we will query the unknown contractor
                            , trying to blame someone for our woe of stressful pushing
                            and dragging. You cannot afford not being stained with
                            mould-like dirt of unclean oiled beans and other food
                            remnants. Those wooden benches and tables - receptacles
                            of hot beans and ogbolo soups.<br>
                            To some then, it was more important than the class desks
                            and chairs; to some of us, veteran table soccer d&eacute;tente,
                            we wouldn't forget those tables in a hurry and the pain
                            it caused our fragile finger nails . The tables at the
                            blue house section...near the kitchen..that still retains
                            the veneer and glossy surface were our choice turf. What
                            people like Arewa, Loko, Aderemi , Bolaji Ashiru etc were
                            doing on the football pitch we took solace doing it on
                            a table ! You need to see the way we package individuals'
                            teams and name them after great squads.</p>
                          <p><br>
                            The carol will start , choirs sing and the preacher tells
                            us something about the little infant Jesus.....and father
                            Xmas will just play round dropping gifts here and there.
                          </p>
                          <p>i wouldn't forget this song: </p>
                          <p>Angels from that realms of glory, <br>
                            Wing your flight o'er all the earth<br>
                            Ye who sang creation's story <br>
                            Now proclaim messiah birth ...<br>
                            <i>And the famous chorus follows </i><br>
                            come come and worship ..<br>
                            <b>and those of us at the rear end of the hall will change
                            the chorus to;</b><br>
                            come and come and jegba ( be caned) <br>
                            come and korin(sing)<br>
                            come and so'omo (toast a girl)<br>
                            come and come ...and come and eat&#133;&#133;..!</p>
                          <p>Well folks, all is not about food! The excitement died
                            the moment you are woken up the next morning, then the
                            chapel prefect dilemma starts, chasing home-bound students
                            to rearrange all the tables for the final assembly. Then
                            you will see luxurious buses maneuvering themselves and
                            anxious parent looking for tired wards. Then you know
                            the year is about ending.</p>
                          <p class="fields">Undoubtedly things have changed now, but
                            we can't trade off the experiences and the feelings of
                            those days . we all put our best into such activities
                            and somehow might have been responsible for what ever
                            we have achieved today. Sometimes looking back could elicit
                            pleasure and sometimes pain, but the fun here is remembering
                            it and chuckling. </p>
